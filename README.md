# Hi! I am Aku! ðŸ‘‹ 

#### Full-Stack Developer.

My journey into the world of programming began out of curiosity. I was always fascinated by how different software works and wanted to understand the magic behind it. This led me to write my first line of HTML and CSS and then there was no turning back. The more I delved into it, the more I fell in love with the process of creating something from nothing but lines of code.

The challenges I faced and the satisfaction of overcoming them made me realize that programming is not just about writing code, it's about problem-solving, continuous learning, and perseverance. It's been a rewarding journey so far, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.
